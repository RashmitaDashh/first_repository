Steps to upload file(a slightly different way as suggested by chatgpt):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  HttpStatus, RequestParam, ResponseEntity- Structure HttpStatus, accept a file from web browser, set response status
	@RestController, @RequestMapping, @PostMapping- Define REST end points
	MultipartFile - represents a file upload in HTTP request
	StringUtils - contains cleanPath() to sanitize file names
	java.nio.file - contains path, paths, files to handle file paths and file system operations
